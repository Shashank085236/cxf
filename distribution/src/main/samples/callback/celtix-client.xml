  <!-- configuration for the demo client -->

  <!-- to specify non-default configuration for a configurable component, supply a bean definition for this 
       component with
       
       Class: the class name of the bean is derived from the namespace uri of
       the component's configuration in the following way:
       The namespace uri is converted into a package name. To this, the suffix
       'spring' is appended, and finally the actual class name obtained by
       converting the last part of the package name into a class name and
       suffixing it with 'Bean'.
       Example: 
       The namespace uri for the Port component configuration is 
           http://celtix.objectweb.org/bus/jaxws/port-config
       The resulting bean class is
           org.objectweb.celtix.bus.jaxws.port_config.spring.PortConfigBean
     
       Id: a unique identifier for the instance of the configurable component
       represented by the bean.  The implementation for this is component
       specific, e.g. for the Bus component it is the bus's id (default:
       celtix), for Port components it the id of the bus, followed by a '.'
       and the stringified presentation of the service's QName, then followed
       by a '/' and the port name etc. 
       
       This is because the bean id needs to be unique across all beans, not
       just across all beans of the same class.
       
       The actual component's configuration then is composed of <property>
       elements, the name attribute of which must be the name of one of the
       component's configuration items.  The (non-default) value for that
       item can be specified either as text (if this is possible, e.g. for 
       strings) or as the content of the <value> element.
       
       Refer to the component configuration metadata (e.g. to port-config.xml)
       for more information about possible values.
