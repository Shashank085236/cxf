This directory contains all the CXF modules. These different modules
have been combined into one cxf.jar in the top directory for your 
convenience. You do NOT need both these jars and the cxf.jar.
If you wish to pick and choose and use just specific portions 
of CXF as opposed to using the one large jar, you can use these jars
instead.

There is also a manifest jar included in this directory to make it 
easy to depend on these modules inside your build system. If you
add cxf-manifest-incubator.jar to your classpath, it will find all
the CXF dependencies in the directory and also add them to the 
classpath automatically.
