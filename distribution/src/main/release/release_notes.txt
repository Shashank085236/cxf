Apache CXF 2.1.7 Release Notes

1. Overview

Apache CXF 2.1.7 delivers the latest set of patches and bug fixes for the Apache
CXF 2.1.x branch.   This release fixes 25 JIRA issues that have been reported by 
users.

2. Installation Prerequisites 

Before installing Apache CXF, make sure the following products,
with the specified versions, are installed on your system:

    * Java 5 Development Kit
    * Apache ant 1.6

2.1 Java 5 Development Kit

You must install the J2SE Development Kit (JDK) 5.0 or 6, which can be downloaded
from:

    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp

After installing the JDK, set or modify the following environment variables:

    * JAVA_HOME -- set this environment variable
      to point at the root directory of the JDK 5.0 installation.

    * PATH -- make sure that your PATH includes: 
      %JAVA_HOME%\bin  (Windows) 
      $JAVA_HOME/bin   (UNIX)

2.2 Apache Ant 1.6.5 (or newer, 1.7.0 should work as well)

To run samples included in the binary distribution of Apache CXF,
you must install the Apache Ant 1.6.5 build utility, which can be downloaded
from:

    http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

After installing Apache Ant, add the <AntInstallDir>/bin directory to your PATH.

For more details, see the Installation Guide.



3. Building the Samples

Building the samples included in the binary distribution is easy. Change to
the samples directory and follow the build instructions in the README.txt file 
included with each sample.

4. Errata

4.1 WS-Security
The WS-Security configuration mechanisms may change between this release and 
the next one as we add in support for WS-SecurityPolicy and WS-Trust.

5. Reporting Problems

If you have any problems or want to send feedback of any kind, please e-mail the
cxf dev list, cxf-dev@incubator.apache.org.  You can also file issues in JIRA at:

http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF


6. JAX-RS/JSR-311

2.1.2 upgraded the JAX-RS/JSR-311 support level to 0.8 from 0.6.   This may cause 
existing JAX-RS applications to fail.  JAX-RS/JSR-311 is a work in progress and as
the specification changes, we'll be updating the implementation to keep track with 
the specification.   However, users of JAX-RS are highly encouraged to migrate to 
CXF 2.2.2 or newer as the JAX-RS implementations there are fully JAX-RS 1.0 
compliant.


7. Specific issues, features, and improvements fixed in this version 

** Bug
    * [CXF-2301] - If a service is published with escaped address, it cannot be accessed from the service location in the WSDL.
    * [CXF-2308] - Invalid signature of cxf.apache.org/javadoc/latest/org/apache/cxf/ws/addressing/AddressingProperties.html#setTo
    * [CXF-2380] - Cannot use custom client TLS settings when creating javax.xml.ws.Service from "https://...?wsdl" URL when WSDL contains https imports
    * [CXF-2381] - Attachments gone when in Multi-Threaded client
    * [CXF-2398] - JMS Connections are not closed when JCA recycles CXF proxy
    * [CXF-2409] - ClientOutFaultObserver in ClientImpl not initialized (no callback on client code)
    * [CXF-2415] - Dynamic client returns a T when it should return a List<T>
    * [CXF-2419] - WSDL2Java -allowElementReferences causes fatal errors in operation dispatching
    * [CXF-2421] - Get the UnsupportedOperationException when reinstalling a cxf related bundle in OSGi platform
    * [CXF-2425] - OSGi metadata does not handle well multiple versions of CXF bundle
    * [CXF-2431] - NullPointerException from wsdl2java with no explanation
    * [CXF-2432] - subscriptionDurable is commented in JMSFactory
    * [CXF-2436] - SEI should be able to implements java.rmi.Remote
    * [CXF-2440] - GZIP and MTOM attachments does not work on client
    * [CXF-2442] - fail to create a service model from class when: BARE parameter style, XmlBeans data binding, XmlBeans' source is WSDL file
    * [CXF-2444] - org.apache.cxf.service.model.InterfaceInfo attributes are not passed to the WSDL PortType during WSDL generation.
