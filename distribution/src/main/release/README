Welcome to Apache Incubator CXF!
======================
Apache Incubator CXF simplifies the construction, integration, and flexible reuse of technical and business components using a standards-based, service-oriented architecture (SOA). It provides a pluggable architecture that supports not only XML but also non-XML type bindings in combination with any type of transport. It also supports several programming languages like JAX-WS, JBI, SCA, and CORBA services and is designed for flexible deployment in a variety of containers including Spring-based, JBI, SCA, Servlet and J2EE containers. The broad range of flexibility makes it possible to create and integrate web services and legacy services using a single framework.


Incubation Disclaimer
=====================
Apache Incubator CXF is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. 

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
