Building Apache CXF
=====================

Initial Setup
-------------

1) Install J2SE 5.0 SDK, which can be downloaded from 
   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp, use version of 1.5.0_06 JDK.

2) Make sure your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to newly installed 
   JDK location, and your PATH includes %JAVA_HOME%\bin (windows) or 
   $JAVA_HOME$/bin (unix) directory.

3) Install Maven 2.0.4, which can be downloaded from 
   http://maven.apache.org/download.html. Make sure that your PATH includes 
   MVN_HOME/bin directory. 


Building
--------

1) Change to the top level directory of Apache CXF source distribution.
2) run 
         $> mvn
   which will compile Apache CXF and run all tests under Apache CXF source
   distribution. Alternatively, you can also run
         $> mvn -Pfastinstall
   which will compile Apache CXF without running all tests and takes short
   time to build. Depending on the load of remote Maven 2.0 repositories, 
   you may have to run "mvn" several times util required dependencies are 
   all located in your local maven repository. It usually takes some for 
   maven to download required dependencies in the first build.

Building kit
------------
1) change to the "distribution" directory of Apache CXF source distribution.
2) run 
         $> mvn
   which will build Apache CXF distribution kit under "distribution/target"
   directory.
