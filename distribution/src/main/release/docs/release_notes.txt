Apache CXF 2.0 M1 Release Notes

1. Apache CXF 2.0 M1 release delivers the merge of Celtix project
(http://celtix.objectweb.org) and Xfire project (http://xfire.codehaus.org),
thus this release includes all major features from historical Celtix and Xfire
projects:
    * JAX-WS 2.0 implementation
    * Transports: HTTP 1.1, HTTPS, and JMS
    * Full SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 implementation, with MTOM/XOP support
    * JAXB 2.0 databinding support
    * StAX-based XML streaming
    * WS-Addressing support
    * JCA 1.0 Support
    * Spring support, including spring-based configuration and spring-based
      lightweight container
    * Servlet container support
    * Complete tooling support, including wsdl2java and java2wsdl, plus a
      bunch of other convenient tools.
    * RESTful web service support

2. Installation Prerequisites 

Before installing Apache CXF, make sure the following products,
with the specified versions, are installed on your system:

    * Java 5 Development Kit
    * Apache ant 1.6

2.1 Java 5 Development Kit

You must install the J2SE Development Kit (JDK) 5.0, which can be downloaded from:

    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp

After installing the JDK, set or modify the following environment variables:

    * JAVA_HOME -- set this environment variable
      to point at the root directory of the JDK 5.0 installation.

    * PATH -- make sure that your PATH includes: 
      %JAVA_HOME%\bin  (Windows) 
      $JAVA_HOME/bin   (UNIX)

2.2 Apache Ant 1.6.5

To run samples included in the binary distribution of Apache CXF, you must
install the Apache Ant 1.6.5 build utility, which can be downloaded from:

    http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

After installing Apache Ant, add the <AntInstallDir>/bin directory to your PATH.

For more details, see the Apache CXF Installation Guide.


3. Building samples

Building samples included in binary distribution is easy. Please change to
samples directory and following build instruction readme.txt under each
sample.

4. Known Problems

3.1 HTTP
There is an issue with Jetty HTTP that prevents Apache CXF from being able to 
shut down the actual port listener.  If you programmatically remove the last endpoint
published on a port, the listener remains running on the port, but only 404
(page not found) errors are served to all client connections.

3.2 Schema Definitions
There is no support for nillable elements in XML Schema and xsi:nil attribute 
in XML documents.

4. Reporting Problems

If you have any problems or want to send feedback of any kind, please e-mail the
cxf dev list, cxf-dev@incupator.apache.org.
