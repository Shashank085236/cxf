JMS Transport Demo using Document-Literal Style.
==========================================================

This sample demonstrates use of the Document-Literal style
binding over JMS transport using the pub/sub mechanism.

Please review the README in the samples directory before
continuing.



Prerequisite
------------

If your environment already includes cxf-incubator.jar on the
CLASSPATH, and the JDK and ant bin directories on the PATH
it is not necessary to set the environment as described in
the samples directory README.  If your environment is not
properly configured, or if you are planning on using wsdl2java,
javac, and java to build and run the demos, you must set the
environment.

This demo requires ActiveMQ 4.1.X. Before you run this
demo, please make sure you had installed the ActiveMQ 4.1.X and
set ACTIVEMQ_HOME and ACTIVEMQ_VERSION environment variables.
Also, the ACTIVEMQ_VERSION environment variable should include the 
'-incubator' suffix. For example,

For Unix:
export ACTIVEMQ_VERSION=4.1.0-incubator

For Windows:
set ACTIVEMQ_VERSION=4.1.0-incubator
 

Before you run this demo, start up the JMS message broker.

From ActiveMQ 4.1.X insallation launch ActiveMQ JMS Broker in seperate window
or in background using the commands:

For Unix:
cd <activemq.home.dir>/bin
activemq

For Windows:
cd <activemq.home.dir>\bin
activemq.bat

The location of <activemq.home.dir> depends on whether you have installed the
binary or source release.



Building and running the demo using ant
---------------------------------------

From the samples/jms_pubsub directory, the ant build script
can be used to build and run the demo.

Using either UNIX or Windows:

  ant build
  ant jmsbroker.start 
  ant server
  ant client
    

To remove the code generated from the WSDL file and the .class
files, run:

  ant clean



Building the demo using wsdl2java and javac
-------------------------------------------

From the samples/jms_pubsub directory, first create the target
directory build/classes and then generate code from the WSDL file.

For UNIX:
  mkdir -p build/classes

  wsdl2java -d build/classes -compile ./wsdl/jms_greeter.wsdl

For Windows:
  mkdir build\classes
    Must use back slashes.

  wsdl2java -d build\classes -compile .\wsdl\jms_greeter.wsdl
    May use either forward or back slashes.

Now compile the provided client and server applications with the commands:

For UNIX:  
  
  export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$CXF_HOME/lib/cxf-incubator.jar:./build/classes:
$ACTIVEMQ_HOME/apache-activemq-$ACTIVEMQ_VERSION.jar
  javac -d build/classes src/demo/jms_greeter/client/*.java
  javac -d build/classes src/demo/jms_greeter/server/*.java

For Windows:
  set classpath=%classpath%;%CXF_HOME%\lib\cxf-incubator.jar;.\build\classes;
%ACTIVEMQ_HOME%\apache-activemq-%ACTIVEMQ_VERSION%.jar
  javac -d build\classes src\demo\jms_greeter\client\*.java
  javac -d build\classes src\demo\jms_greeter\server\*.java

Running the demo using java
---------------------------

The location of <activemq.home.dir> depends on whether you have installed the
binary or source release.  

From the samples/jms_pubsub directory run the commands, entered on a
single command line:

For UNIX (must use forward slashes):
    java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=$CXF_HOME/etc/logging.properties
         demo.jms_greeter.server.Server &

    java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=$CXF_HOME/etc/logging.properties
         demo.jms_greeter.client.Client ./wsdl/jms_greeter.wsdl

The server process starts in the background.  After running the client,
use the kill command to terminate the server process.

For Windows (may use either forward or back slashes):
  start 
    java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=%CXF_HOME%\etc\logging.properties
       demo.jms_greeter.server.Server   

    java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=%CXF_HOME%\etc\logging.properties
       demo.jms_greeter.client.Client .\wsdl\jms_greeter.wsdl

A new command windows opens for the server process.  After running the
client, terminate the server process by issuing Ctrl-C in its command window.


Now you can stop ActiveMQ JMS Broker by issuing Ctrl-C in its command window.

To remove the code generated from the WSDL file and the .class
files, either delete the build directory and its contents or run:

  ant clean
