Celtix Management
====================

This demo illustrates how to use the Celtix management facilities.
Information in the configuration file is used to change the
management facilities operations. 

Instrumentation is enabled by setting the bus to handle the celtix basic 
component created and removed events. JMX is enabled to export the
basic componnet information through the JMX MBeanServer.

When setting up the JMX MBServer, you need to do the following:
1. Set the MBServer to use either the PlatformMBeanServer or your prefered
   MBeanServer implementation.
2. Specify the connector URL which the manager client connecot uses to
   connect to the MBServer.
3. Set the connector to run in a seperated thread or to run in the deamon
   mode. 

Please review the README in the samples directory before
continuing.



Prerequisites
-------------

1. celtix.jar must be on your CLASSPATH.
2. JDK 1.5 or higher must be on your PATH
3. ant must be on your PATH

If your environment is not properly configured, or if you are planning on
using wsdl2java, javac, and java to build and run the demos, you must set
the environment by running the script.

If you set the Celtix configuration properties instrumentEnabled and
JMXEnabled to true, and set up the MBServer to use PlateformMBeanserver, you
can use jconsole, which comes with  JDK1.5, to explore the Celtix managed
components.



Building and running the demo using ant
---------------------------------------

From the samples/management directory, the ant build script
can be used to build and run the demo.

To build the demo:
  ant build

To run the demo:
  ant server  (in the background or another window)
  ant client

To explore the celtix managed components:
  jconsole  (in the background or another window)
  
  The server JMX Service URL is:
    service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi/server  

  The client JMX Service URL is:
    service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi/client

To remove the code generated from the WSDL file and the .class
files, run:
  ant clean


Buildng the demo using wsdl2java and javac
------------------------------------------

From the samples/hello_world directory:
1. create the target directory build/classes.

UNIX:
  mkdir -p build/classes

Windows:
  mkdir build\classes

2. Generate code from the WSDL file.

UNIX:
  wsdl2java -d build/classes -compile ./wsdl/hello_world.wsdl

Windows:
  wsdl2java -d build\classes -compile .\wsdl\hello_world.wsdl

3. Compile the provided client and server applications.

UNIX:  
  
  export classpath=$CLASSPATH:$CELTIX_HOME/lib/celtix.jar:./build/classes
  javac -d build/classes src/demo/hw/client/*.java
  javac -d build/classes src/demo/hw/server/*.java

Windows:
  set classpath=%classpath%;%CELTIX_HOME%\lib\celtix.jar:.\build\classes
  javac -d build\classes src\demo\hw\client\*.java
  javac -d build\classes src\demo\hw\server\*.java



Running the demo using java
---------------------------

From the samples/hello_world directory run the commands, entered on a
single command line:

UNIX:
    java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=$CELTIX_HOME/etc/logging.properties
	-Dceltix.config.file=file:///$CELTIX_HOME/samples/management/server.xml
         demo.hw.server.Server &

    java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=$CELTIX_HOME/etc/logging.properties
         -Dceltix.config.file=file:///$CELTIX_HOME/samples/management/client.xml
         demo.hw.client.Client ./wsdl/hello_world.wsdl

The server process starts in the background.  After running the client,
use the kill command to terminate the server process.

Windows:
  start 
    java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=%CELTIX_HOME%\etc\logging.properties
	 -Dceltix.config.file=file:///%CELTIX_HOME%\samples\management\server.xml 
         demo.hw.server.Server 

    java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=%CELTIX_HOME%\etc\logging.properties
        -Dceltix.config.file=file:///%CELTIX_HOME%\samples\management\client.xml
         demo.hw.client.Client .\wsdl\hello_world.wsdl

A new command windows opens for the server process.  After running the
client, terminate the server process by issuing Ctrl-C in its command window.

To explore the celtix managed components   
  jconsole
  
  The Server JMX Service URL is:
  service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi/server
  
  The Client JMX Service URL is:
  service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi/client
  

To remove the code generated from the WSDL file and the .class
files, either delete the build directory and its contents or run:
  ant clean



Understanding the configuration file
------------------------------------

The configuration files, server.xml and client.xml, are mostly the same.
They each include one <bean> definition which has two properties. 
The first property specifies the information needed to set the
Instrumentation manager and JMX manager enabled property.
The second property specifies the information needed to set the 
MBServer to use the PlatformMBeanServer, the JMXConnectorServer's 
basic run mode, and the JMXConnectorServer's connector URL. 

In writing this file, refer to the schema and XML metadata files
that are included within the resources directory under the Celtix
installation.  The tutorial "Using Celtix Configuration" presents a
detailed discussion on how these files are used to compose the
configuration file.

When setting the celtix instrumentation facilities, you are 
configuring the Celtix bus to be instrumented and to use JMX 
to export the managed resources.

Because the instrumentation is a part of the bus, we put the 
instrumentation configuration as a child of the bus . The configuration
id is "instrumentation". The appropriate XML metadata file to use 
as a guide is resources/config-metadata/instrumentation-config.xml, 
and the desired <configItem> is instrumentationControl. Assign 
the value of the configItem's <name> element to the <property> element's
name attribute.  Within the <value>...</value> tags,
you will enter the proper XML as the configuration value for your
defined service.  

Look at the schema file resources/config-metadaata/instrumentation-config.xml
and note that the instrumentationContorl entry corresponds to the
InstrumentationPolicy type defined in the schema file 
resources/schemas.wsdl/instrumentation.xsd. However,
since the InstrumentationPolicy type is a complex type, and the 
configuration file must include two element types, you identify the
InstrumentationEnabled and JMXEnabled elements as a suitable replacement. 
Then you look up the composition of the InstrumentationPolicy type
and determine that it is a sequence of elements:
InstrumentationEnabled and JMXEnabled.  Combining this
information, leads to the following <bean> declaration.  Note the use of the
sec: namespace prefix. You must include the corresponding namespace
declaration at the beginning of the configuration file. 

If we set JMXEnabled to be true, we should set up the MBServer's 
<property> to make sure the MBServer can be accessed by jconsole.
Setting the PlatformMBeanServer to be true means that Celtix's 
MBServer is getted from PlatformMBeanServer. Note: in this case we should 
pass an option to JVM "-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote", which means the 
platformMBeanServer can be monitored by local jconsole. 

Setting the PlatformMBeanServer to be false means that celtix's 
MBeanServer is created by itself. We can set the JMXConnectorServer 
to run in a separated thread or to run in the daemon mode, and we can
set the JMXServiceURL which is used by Jconsol to connect with the
MBeanServer. Note: in this case we should run an rmiregistry to listen to port 
9913 for the JMXConnectorServer to register.
