2. Installation Prerequisites 

Before installing Celtix Milestone 4, you must ensure that the following products
with the specified versions are installed on your system:

    * Java 5 developer's kit.
    * Apache ant 1.6.


2.1 Java 5 developer's kit

You need to install the J2SE Development Kit (JDK) 5.0, which can be downloaded from
the following location:

    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp

After installing the JDK, you should set or modify the following environment variables:

    * JAVA_HOME environment variable - set this environment variable
      to point at the root directory of the JDK 5.0 installation.

    * PATH environment variable - ensure that your PATH includes the 
      %JAVA_HOME%\bin directory (Windows) 
      or, $JAVA_HOME/bin directory (UNIX).

If you are planning on building Celtix from the source distribution you should use
version 1.5.0_06 of the JDK. Earlier versions will result in a number of compiler warnings
when build Celtix. The warnings can be ignored.

2.2 Apache ant 1.6

If you are planning to install the binary distribution of Celtix, you must
install the Apache ant 1.6 build utility, which can be downloaded from the
following location:

    http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

After installing Apache ant, add the <AntInstallDir>/bin directory to your PATH.

If you are planning to install the source distribution of Celtix, you can optionally
use the ant installation provided with that distribution.
For more details, see the Celtix Installation Guide.


3. Known Problems

3.1 HTTP
There is an issue with the Jetty HTTP that prevents Celtix from being able to 
shutdown the actual port listener.   If you programmatically remove the last endpoint
published on a port, the listener will remain running on the port, but will only 
serve 404 (not found) errors to all client connections.


3.2 JMS

3.2.1 WS-Addressing Support
The JMS transport does not currently use policy based configuration, or support WS-Addressing.

3.2.2 Pubsub Demo
The pubsub demo fails when the following is done:
1. Start JMS Broker, Server and run client this works fine.
2. Kill JMS Broker, kill server.
3. Again Start JMS Broker, Server and run client this works fine.
4. Kill JMS Broker, Kill server.
5. Start JMS Broker and Start Server, this time Server will hang and will not show "Server Ready"

The work around is to ensure to clean up database before running the demo.
This can be done by calling "ant clean"
