2. Installation Prerequisites 

Before installing Celtix 1.0, make sure the following products,
with the specified versions, are installed on your system:

    * Java 5 Development Kit
    * Apache ant 1.6


2.1 Java 5 Development Kit

You must install the J2SE Development Kit (JDK) 5.0, which can be downloaded from:

    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp

After installing the JDK, set or modify the following environment variables:

    * JAVA_HOME -- set this environment variable
      to point at the root directory of the JDK 5.0 installation.

    * PATH -- make sure that your PATH includes: 
      %JAVA_HOME%\bin  (Windows) 
      $JAVA_HOME/bin   (UNIX)

If you are planning on building Celtix from the source distribution, use 
version 1.5.0_06 of the JDK. Earlier versions will result in a number of compiler
warnings when building Celtix. The warnings can be ignored.

2.2 Apache Ant 1.6

If you are planning to install the binary distribution of Celtix, you must
install the Apache Ant 1.6 build utility, which can be downloaded from:

    http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

After installing Apache Ant, add the <AntInstallDir>/bin directory to your PATH.

If you are planning to install the source distribution of Celtix, you can optionally
use the Ant installation provided with that distribution.

For more details, see the Celtix Installation Guide.


3. Known Problems

3.1 HTTP
There is an issue with Jetty HTTP that prevents Celtix from being able to 
shut down the actual port listener.  If you programmatically remove the last endpoint
published on a port, the listener remains running on the port, but only 404
(page not found) errors are served to all client connections.

3.2 Schema Definitions
There is no support for nillable elements in XML Schema and xsi:nil attribute 
in XML documents.

4. Reporting Problems

If you have any problems or want to send feedback of any kind, please e-mail the
Celtix dev list, celtix-dev@objectweb.org.
