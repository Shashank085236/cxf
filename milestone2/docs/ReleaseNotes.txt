Before installing Celtix Milestone 2, you must ensure that the following 
products with the specified versions are installed on your system:

    * Java 5 developer’s kit.
    * Apache ant 1.6.


2.1 Java 5 developer’s kit

You need to install the J2SE Development Kit (JDK) 5.0, which can be 
downloaded from the following location:

    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp

After installing the JDK, you should set or modify the following 
environment variables:

    * JAVA_HOME environment variable — set this environment variable
      to point at the root directory of the JDK 5.0 installation.

    * PATH environment variable — ensure that your PATH includes the 
      %JAVA_HOME%\bin directory (Windows) 
      or, $JAVA_HOME/bin directory (UNIX).


2.2 Apache ant 1.6

If you are planning to install the binary distribution of Celtix, you must
install the Apache ant 1.6 build utility, which can be downloaded from the
following location:

    http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

After installing Apache ant, add the <AntInstallDir>/bin directory to
your PATH.

If you are planning to install the source distribution of Celtix, 
you can optionally use the ant installation provided with that distribution.
For more details, see Installation Instructions below.


3. Installation Instructions

You can install Celtix on any Operating System that supports the 
Java 5 platform. To install Celtix Milestone 2, perform the following steps:

   1. Unpack the .tgz file into a directory of your choice, <CeltixInstallDir>. 
      You can use Gnu tar and gunzip on UNIX-like systems or the Winzip 
      utility on Windows for that purpose.
   2. Set the environment variable, CELTIX_HOME, to point to the directory, 
      <CeltixInstallDir>/celtix.
   3. If you are installing the source distribution and you want to use the 
      version of ant included in this distribution, add the 
      $CELTIX_HOME/tools/ant/1.6.5/bin directory to your PATH.
   4. If you are installing the source distribution, you must build the 
      celtix.jar JAR file. To build the JAR file, open a command prompt, 
      change directory to $CELTIX_HOME, and enter ant celtix.jar.


4. Testing the Installation

To test the installation of Celtix, try running the Hello World demonstration,
located in $CELTIX_HOME/samples/hello_world. To build and run the Hello World
demonstration, perform the following steps:

   1. Open a command prompt and change directory to 
      $CELTIX_HOME/samples/hello_world.
   2. Enter the command, ant build, to build the demonstration.
   3. Open a new command prompt, change directory to the 
      $CELTIX_HOME/samples/hello_world directory, and enter the command,
      ant server. The server takes a few seconds to start up.
   4. From the first command prompt, enter the command, 
      ant client -Dop=sayHi. 
      See the README.txt file for more client options.
   5. To terminate the server process, type Ctrl-C in the server window.

5. Running the Unit and System Tests

If you have installed the source distribution of Celtix, you can run the full
suite of unit and system tests by performing the following steps:

   1. Add $CELTIX_HOME/tools/junit/3.8.1/junit.jar to your CLASSPATH. 
      Note: Alternatively, you could add the junit.jar file to the lib 
      directory of your ant installation.
   2. Change directory to $CELTIX_HOME, and enter the command, 
      ant test.

The build.xml file in CELTIX_HOME provides several targets for compiling 
and running tests. For a summary of the targets, enter ant -projecthelp.
