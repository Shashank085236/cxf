<FONT COLOR="#cc6633"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>Q1: How many
Celtix licensing options do I have to choose from?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>A1: Two. One option is primarily
licensed under the LGPL; the other option is primarily licensed under
the EPL.  To ensure there is no confusion about which license a user
is accepting, Celtix offers separate distributions: one primarily
licensed under the LGPL and one primarily licensed under the EPL.</FONT></P>
<P><A NAME="0.Q2: Why are there these two options_  Why not just stick to one or the other_|outline"></A>
<FONT COLOR="#cc6633"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>Q2: Why are
there these two options?  Why not just stick to one or the other?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>A2: The LGPL option allows
compatibility with other free software projects, such as those
licensed under the GPL and LGPL; most importantly, the LGPL option
allows maximum compatibility with most other ObjectWeb projects. The
EPL option is more compatible with many other open source projects,
specifically, with Apache and Eclipse projects. For example, the
Eclipse SOA Tools Platform project will be including parts of Celtix
in its distribution. Both the EPL and LGPL include a clause that
requires that derivative works be distributed under the same license
as the work from which it is derived.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#cc6633"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>Q3: What is
meant above by &ldquo;primarily licensed under&hellip;&rdquo;? What
other licenses are relevant to the Celtix distributions?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>A3: All new code written for and
contributed to the Celtix project is licensed under both the LGPL and
the EPL. In addition, the same licenses apply to the collective work,
known as a &ldquo;Celtix distribution&rdquo;. However, Celtix uses
and redistributes a few other open source components that are
licensed differently. As of December 2005, the Celtix binary
distribution includes third-party components licensed under the
Apache License CDDL, and CPL (all approved by the Open Source
Initiative).</FONT></P>
<P><A NAME="0.Q4: How can I find out exactly what third-party components are included in Celtix and what licenses are applicable to them_|outline"></A>
<FONT COLOR="#cc6633"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>Q4: How can I
find out exactly what third-party components are included in Celtix
and what licenses are applicable to them?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>A4: There are several ways the Celtix
team tries to make the licensing of Celtix and its components clear
to users:</FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Each Celtix distribution includes a file named
	<FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=2>3party-licenses.txt</FONT></FONT></FONT>
	that identifies the name of each third-party component and its
	applicable license. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The directory containing each third-party component will also
	include a copy of the applicable license.</P>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>The Celtix committers do all this
because we respect the intellectual property rights and licenses of
others, and we want to make it easy for our users and redistributors
to do the same.</FONT></P>
<P><A NAME="0.Q5: Could the Celtix source and binary distributions have different applicable licenses_|outline"></A>
<FONT COLOR="#cc6633"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>Q5: Could the
Celtix source and binary distributions have different applicable
licenses?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>Q5: Yes. In addition to all the
components included in the binary distribution, the source
distribution includes some tools necessary for building and
contributing to the project.  These tools may be licensed differently
than the other components that are also found in the binary
distribution. The <FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=2>3party-licenses.txt</FONT></FONT></FONT>
file will list exactly what these components are and what the
applicable license is for each one. However, aside from third-party
components, the core Celtix code is still licensed under both the EPL
or LGPL (your choice), for both source and binary form.</FONT></P>
