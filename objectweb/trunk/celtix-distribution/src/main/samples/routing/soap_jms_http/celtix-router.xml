  <!-- configuration for the pass through router in soap_jms_http demo -->

  <!-- to specify non-default configuration for a configurable component, supply a bean definition for this
       component with

       Class: the class name of the bean is derived from the namespace uri of the component's configuration
       in the following way:
       The namespace uri is converted into a package name. To this, the suffix 'spring' is appended, and
       finally the actual class name obtained by converting the last part of the package name into a class name
       and suffixing it with 'Bean'.
       Example:
       The namespace uri for the Routing component configuration is
           http://celtix.objectweb.org/routing/configuration
       The resulting bean class is
           org.objectweb.celtix.routing.configuration.spring.ConfigurationBean

       Id: a unique identifier for the instance of the configurable component represented by the bean
       The implementation for this is component specific, e.g. for the Bus component it is the bus's id
       (default: celtix), for Service components it the id of the bus, followed by a '.' and the id for the Router
       which is "router".

       The actual component's configuration then is composed of <property> elements, the name attribute of which
       must be the name of one of the component's configuration items.
       The (non-default) value for that item can be specified either as text (if this is possible, e.g. for
       strings) or as the content of the <value> element.

       In case of the router configuration the property name is routesWSDL and takes a string value representing a
       path to the wsdl which defines the route elements.

       Refer to the component configuration metadata (e.g. to router-config.xml) for more information
       about possible values.
