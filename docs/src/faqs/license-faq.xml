    <faq>
      <question>
		How many Celtix licensing options do I have to choose from?
      </question>
      <answer>
      Two. One option is primarily licensed under the LGPL; the other option is primarily licensed 
	  under the EPL.  To ensure there is no confusion about which license a user is accepting, 
	  Celtix offers separate distributions: one primarily licensed under the LGPL and one primarily 
	  licensed under the EPL.
      </answer>
    </faq>
		<faq>
	<question>
	Why are there these two options?  Why not just stick to one or the other?
	</question>
	<answer>
	The LGPL option allows compatibility with other free software projects, such as those 
	licensed under the GPL and LGPL. The EPL option is more compatible with many other 
	open source projects, specifically, with Apache and Eclipse projects. For example, the Eclipse 
	SOA Tools Platform project will be including parts of Celtix in its distribution. Both the EPL 
	and LGPL include a clause that requires that derivative works be distributed under the same 
	license as the work from which it is derived.
	</answer>
	</faq>
	<faq>
	<question>
	What is meant above by "primarily licensed under"? What other licenses are relevant to the Celtix distributions?
	</question>
	<answer>
	All new code written for and contributed to the Celtix project is licensed under both the LGPL and 
	the EPL. In addition, the same licenses apply to the collective work, known as a "Celtix distribution". 
	However, Celtix uses and redistributes a few other open source components that are licensed 
	differently. As of December 2005, the Celtix binary distribution includes third-party components 
	licensed under the Apache License CDDL, and CPL (all approved by the Open Source Initiative).

	</faq>
	<faq>
	<question>
    How can I find out exactly what third-party components are included in Celtix and what licenses are applicable to them?
	</question>
	<answer>
    <p>There are several ways the Celtix team tries to make the licensing of Celtix and its components clear to users:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Each Celtix distribution includes a file named <code>3party-licenses.txt</code> that identifies the name 
	    of each third-party component and its applicable license.</li>
	<li>The directory containing each third-party component will also include a copy of the applicable license.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Celtix committers do all this because we respect the intellectual property rights and licenses of others, 
	and we want to make it easy for our users and redistributors to do the same.</p>
	</answer>
	</faq>
		<faq>
	<question>
	Could the Celtix source and binary distributions have different applicable licenses?
	</question>
	<answer>
	Yes. In addition to all the components included in the binary distribution, the source distribution includes 
	some tools necessary for building and contributing to the project.  These tools may be licensed differently 
	than the other components that are also found in the binary distribution. The <code>3party-licenses.txt</code> 
	file will list exactly what these components are and what the applicable license is for each one. However, 
	aside from third-party components, the core Celtix code is still licensed under both the EPL or LGPL 
	(your choice), for both source and binary form.
