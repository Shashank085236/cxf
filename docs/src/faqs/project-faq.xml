	<question>
	What is the road map for CeltiXfire?
	</question>
	<answer>
	As with all open source project road maps, the road map for CeltiXfire is dependent on the 
	needs of the users and the willingness of contributors to work on those features. There 
	is a list of proposed features on the mile stone page at 
	https://wiki.objectweb.org/celtix/Wiki.jsp?page=Milestones. We welcome user feedback 
	on the developer mailing list.

	<question>
	What is a milestone release?
	</question>
	<answer>
	<p>A milestone release is an interim release of CeltiXfire that occurs at regular intervals so that users can 
	take advantage of new features without having to build CeltiXfire from the repository. Each milestone release 
	contains new features and functionality (sometimes, partly implemented), but there is no guarantee that 
	testing is complete. In general, milestone releases should be regarded as less stable and are not 
	suitable for deployment.</p>
    <p>This contrasts with regular releases of CeltiXfire, where every effort is made to ensure that the release 
	is stable and testing is complete.</p>
