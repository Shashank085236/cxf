  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Admonitions are pieces of text that are offset from the main flow of
    text. They include things like warnings, notes, and tips. They should be
    used sparingly because they interrupt the flow of the text. However, if
    you think one is needed, use one.</para>

    <para>As a general rule, warnings and notes are the <emphasis
    role="strong">preferred</emphasis> admonitions in CeltiXfire
    documentation. That does not mean the use of the other types are
    prohibited. It only means that they should be used with caution.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="warn">
    <title>Warnings</title>

    <para>Warnings are used to call out instances where a serious loss of data
    could occur. The text of the warning should make it clear what will cause
    the data loss and what data is at risk. For example, if using a value
    greater than 1 million will cause a method invocation to return garbage,
    use a warning to mention this.</para>

    <para>Warnings are marked up using a <sgmltag
    class="element">warning</sgmltag> element. The <sgmltag
    class="element">warning</sgmltag> element should contain a single <sgmltag
    class="element">para</sgmltag> element that contains the text for the
    warning.</para>

    <para>The <sgmltag class="element">warning</sgmltag> element can, however,
    contain more than one paragraph, a code listing, or a table. These are
    exceptions that are to be used sparingly.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="note">
    <title>Notes</title>

    <para>Notes are used to call out information that the reader should be
    aware of, but is ancillary to the topic being discussed in the main flow
    of the text. For example, if you are discussing the mapping of a CORBA
    service from IDL to WSDL and want to reference the official IDL to WSDL
    mapping, you might put the reference in a note.</para>

    <para>Notes are marked up using a <sgmltag class="element">note</sgmltag>
    element. Like the <sgmltag class="element">warning</sgmltag> element, the
    <sgmltag class="element">note</sgmltag> element should contain a single
    <sgmltag class="element">para</sgmltag> element that contains the text for
    the warning. The <sgmltag class="element">note</sgmltag> element can also
    contain more than one paragraph, a code listing, or a table.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Footnotes</title>

    <para>In general, you should not need to use footnotes in CeltiXfire
    documentation. If you find that a footnote is required, you can use one.
    However, most information that would be put in a footnote is more
    appropriately placed in a note. For example, if there is a related
    specification for a feature or some other ancillary piece of information,
    you might put it in a footnote.</para>

    <para>Footnotes are marked up using the <sgmltag
    class="element">footnote</sgmltag> element. The <sgmltag
    class="element">footnote</sgmltag> element must contain a block element
    such as a <sgmltag class="element">para</sgmltag> element or a <sgmltag
    class="element">table</sgmltag> element. The contents of the footnote will
    be placed according to the formatting rules and a link will be inserted
    where the <sgmltag class="element">footnote</sgmltag> element was in the
    text.</para>

    <para>In addition to using a footnote as a holder for text, you can also
    create a footnote that refers to another footnote. To do this you use the
    <sgmltag class="element">footnoteref</sgmltag> element. It takes a single
    attribute, <sgmltag class="attribute">linkend</sgmltag>, that specifies
    the <sgmltag class="attribute">id</sgmltag> of the referenced footnote.
    The generated link will point back to the referenced footnote.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Others</title>

    <para>In addition to the above admonition types, DocBook has elements for
    three other types:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><link linkend="caution">cautions</link></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><link linkend="important">important notes</link></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><link linkend="tip">tips</link></para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <section id="caution">
      <title>Cautions</title>

      <para>Cautions are intended for use when a <link
      linkend="warn">warning</link> is too strong. For example, a caution may
      be used when an action will potentially cause a service to return an
      exception, but not crash or result in any loss of critical data. In
      general, it is best to use a <link linkend="warn">warning</link>.</para>

      <para>Cautions are marked up using the <sgmltag
      class="element">caution</sgmltag> element. As with warnings elements,
      the <sgmltag class="element">caution</sgmltag> element should contain
      only a single <sgmltag class="element">para</sgmltag> element.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="important">
      <title>Important Notes</title>

      <para>Important notes are used to point out information that is
      important for the user to know, but that may not be obvious. For
      example, if you change a value in a context and the new value overrides
      a transport setting for the service. Or if the new value persists for
      all future uses of the context.</para>

      <para>Important notes are marked up using the <sgmltag
      class="element">important</sgmltag> element. The <sgmltag
      class="element">important</sgmltag> element should contain only a single
      <sgmltag class="element">para</sgmltag> element. However, it is
      allowable to use other block elements in an important note.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="tip">
      <title>Tips</title>

      <para>Tips are bits of information that may help a user be more
      productive, but that are not critical to using the product. In general,
      this type of information should either be worked directly into the text
      or placed in a <link linkend="note">note</link>.</para>

      <para>Tips are marked up using the <sgmltag
      class="element">tip</sgmltag> element. The <sgmltag
      class="element">tip</sgmltag> element should contain only a single
      <sgmltag class="element">para</sgmltag> element. However, it is
      allowable to use other block elements in a tip.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Admonisions in Tables</title>

    <para>Admonision elements should not be placed inside tables. Instead use
    the mark up shown in <xref linkend="admonTable" />.</para>

    <example id="admonTable">
      <title>Mark-up For Admonisions in Tables</title>

      <programlisting>&lt;para&gt;&lt;emphasis role=strong&gt;Note: &lt;/emphasis&gt;Text of note.&lt;/para&gt;</programlisting>
    </example>
