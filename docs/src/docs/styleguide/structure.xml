  <title>Structuring CeltiXFire(CXF) Documents</title>
  <section>
    <title>Top-level Elements</title>
    <para>Because we strive to keep individual documents as specific as
    possible, CXF documents use the <sgmltag class="element">article</sgmltag> element as their root element. If you
    are writing a document that you feel needs to be more than an article,
    consider breaking the topic into smaller chunks. This does not mean you
    cannot link to other documents, but documents should not have such a large
    scope that they need to be more than an article.</para>
    <para><xref linkend="topLevel"/> shows a sample CXF document.</para>
    <example id="topLevel">
      <title>High-level View of a CXF Document</title>
      <programlisting>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

  <section>
    <title>Attributions</title>
    <para>CXF documents do not not use the attribution elements.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Sections</title>
    <para>CXF documents are broken into sections. Generally, a document
    should have five or less sections. If you need more sections, it may be
    because the topic for your document is too broad or you need to reconsider
    how you are chunking the information. Top level sections are denoted using
    <sgmltag class="element">section</sgmltag> elements.</para>
    <para>Top-level sections can be broken down into 5 or less subsections.
    Subsections are denoted using <sgmltag class="element">section</sgmltag>
    elements.</para>
    <para>Like top-level sections, subsections can be broken up into 5 or less
    block-sections. Block-sections are denoted using <sgmltag class="element">section</sgmltag> elements. Block-sections cannot be
    subdivided.</para>
    <para>While it is considered good practice to supply a descriptive value
    for the <sgmltag class="attribute">id</sgmltag> attribute, it is not
    required.</para>
    <para>shows a more detailed view of a CeltiXfire document.</para>
