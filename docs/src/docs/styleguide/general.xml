  <title>Genral Elements and Other Elements not Discussed Elsewhere</title>
  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>
	<para>Since Docbook was defined to describe a wide range of publishable content, it includes 
	      a number of elements that are used to perform common tasks. These elements include ones 
		  that specify superscripts and emphasis.</para>
	<para>It also includes a number of elements that you are unlikely to need when documenting 
	      CeltiXfire. Among these elements are a large set used to define GUI elements. These 
		  elements are legal in the CeltiXfire documentation. However, they are not used enough to 
		  mertit a full discussion.</para>
